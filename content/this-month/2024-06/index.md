### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@josephlr](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/josephlr), and [@Freax13](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/Freax13)</span>

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

We merged the following PR this month:

- [constify PhysFrame functions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/489)

### [`volatile`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp)</span>

The `volatile` crate provides a safe wrapper type for implementing volatile read and write operations. This is useful for accessing memory regions that have side-effects, such as memory-mapped hardware registers.

We merged the following PR this month:

- [Release v0.6.0](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile/pull/64)
