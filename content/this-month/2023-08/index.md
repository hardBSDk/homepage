The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

We merged the following PR this month:

- [Add `inline` attribute to segment functions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/430)
- [Add the `iretq` function to the `InterruptStackFrameValue` struct.](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/431)

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@IsaacWoods](https://github.com/IsaacWoods)</span>

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS. We merged the following changes this month:

- [AML: `DefSizeOf` implementation](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/189)
- [AML: Fix `DefIfElse` parser returning `UnexpectedEndOfStream` when `If (...) {}` is not followed by anything](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/190)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp)</span>

The `uart_16550` crate provides basic support for serial port I/O for 16550-compatible UARTs. We merged the following change this month:

- [x86: crate finally builds with x86 and x86_64](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/pull/29)

Thanks to [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611) for their contributions!


## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.


### [`mkroening/take-static`](https://github.com/mkroening/take-static)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening))</span>

I published a tiny new crate, allowing you to get a mutable reference to static items safely (only once, though):

```rust
use take_static::take_static;

take_static! {
    static NUMBER: usize = 5;
}

assert_eq!(NUMBER.take(), Some(&mut 5));
assert_eq!(NUMBER.take(), None);
```

This allows you to easily use statically allocated memory before dynamic memory allocators may be available.
Compared to [`cortex_m::singleton`], `take_static` is thread-safe.
Compared to [`takecell::TakeCell`], `take_static` also supports `!Send` types.

[`cortex_m::singleton`]: https://docs.rs/cortex-m/0.7.7/cortex_m/macro.singleton.html
[`takecell::TakeCell`]: https://docs.rs/takecell/0.1.1/takecell/index.html


### [`hermit-os/kernel`](https://github.com/hermit-os/kernel)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening))</span>

<img width="128" align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hermit-os/.github/47a27de62e8cfc658ddbccb3f00743c7538281ae/img/Hermit.svg" />

The Hermit unikernel project allows you to bundle your Rust application with our library operating system to create a bootable unikernel image.
Hermit is a single-address-space operating system.
Since there is only one application running in the virtual machine, no isolation between applications or between user space and kernel space is necessary.
This reduces system call overhead immensely, since every system call is just a library call.
For more information, see our [_The Hermit Operating System_] showcase post.

[_The Hermit Operating System_]: @/showcase/hermit/index.md

The RustyHermit project has been renamed.
We have renamed our GitHub organization from [@hermitcore](https://github.com/hermitcore) to [@hermit-os](https://github.com/hermit-os) and reserved the <http://hermit-os.org> domain.

We have also renamed some of our core projects to reduce confusion:
- [hermit-os/kernel](https://github.com/hermit-os/kernel) is the Hermit kernel.
- [hermit-os/hermit-rs](https://github.com/hermit-os/hermit-rs) provides Rust application support.
- [hermit-os/uhyve](https://github.com/hermit-os/uhyve) is a specialized hypervisor for Hermit.
- [hermit-os/loader](https://github.com/hermit-os/loader) is a bootloader for other platforms, such as QEMU.

We have a new logo!
As hermit crabs occupy empty shells produced by other organisms, the original HermitCore occupied one or several cores on a computer.
Because we migrated to Rust in 2018, our new logo of a hermit crab occupying the Rust logo's [bike gear](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=680521) fits quite nicely with the Rust logo as well as Rust's Ferris.

And as always, please come and try Hermit! :)

### [`phil-opp/blog_os`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp))</span>

We merged the following changes to the [_Writing an OS in Rust_](https://os.phil-opp.com/) blog this month:

- [Update post 2 with beginner friendly cargo tips](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1234)
- [Grammar fix](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1235)
- [minimal-rust-kernel: fix missing .toml in zh-CN translation](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1237)

Thanks to [@Connortsui20](https://github.com/Connortsui20) and [@xzmeng](https://github.com/xzmeng) for these contributions!
