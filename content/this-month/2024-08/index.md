### [`multiboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611)</span>

_Convenient and safe parsing of Multiboot2 Boot Information (MBI) structures and
the contained information tags. Usable in no_std environments, such as a kernel. 
An optional builder feature also allows the construction of the corresponding 
structures._

ðŸŽ‰ We are happy to announce release `v0.22` of the `multiboot2` crate. This is a
**major step forward** as all Undefined Behaviour (UB) and a bunch of safety and
memory issues have been removed / fixed. ðŸŽ‰ Now, all unit tests (and there are
many) **pass Miri**! This was possible due to massive internal refactorings done
in [#226](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/226) and [#227](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/227).

The quite complex logic to parse all these structures **safe and correctly**
has been moved to a new [`multiboot2-common`](https://docs.rs/multiboot2-common)
crate. This way, the [`multiboot2-header`](https://crates.io/crates/multiboot2-header)
crate can also leverage the new abstractions. A comprehensive writeup about why 
the parsing of Multiboot2 structures and typing them correctly in Rust is much
more complex than one initially might think is written down in 
[`lib.rs` of `multiboot2-common`](https://docs.rs/multiboot2-common).

`multiboot2-header` also got a new release `v0.5` and can now be considered 
safe and free of UB when parsing the corresponding structures. The internal
refactorings only slightly leak to the public interfaces of `multiboot2`
and `multiboot2-header`.

- [Changelog of `multiboot2-header`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/blob/b95b73508925b5484a0cf531a45c9c9ce555d560/multiboot2-header/Changelog.md)

<details>
<summary>Background - Read More</summary>

The crate grew historically without a centralized design or approach how to work
with memory and pointers. Therefore, many UB way unintentionally created. We 
are happy to get lack of the technical debt. Nevertheless, thanks to everyone
who contributed over the years - sorry if we had to rewrite your code in this 
one! :)
